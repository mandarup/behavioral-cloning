    "* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior\n",
    "* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images\n",
    "* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set\n",
    "* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road\n",

    "#### 1. This repo includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode\n",
    "\n",
    " This repo includes the following files:\n",
    "* model.py containing the script to create and train the model\n",
    "* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode\n",
    "* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network \n",
    "* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Submission includes functional code\n",
    "Using the Udacity provided simulator and drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python drive.py model.h5\n",

    "#### 3. Model script\n",
    "\n",
    "The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline used for training and validating the model.\n"
